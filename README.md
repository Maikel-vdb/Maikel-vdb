## 🚀 My Journey in Development

My passion for development started when I was just 7 years old. Since then, I’ve always been curious and eager to improve my technical abilities. In 2020, I started learning Python and dove into various projects—ranging from simple scripts to more advanced tools. By 2021, I began creating and selling game scripts, which not only sharpened my coding skills but also taught me a lot about business, innovation, and customer relations.
